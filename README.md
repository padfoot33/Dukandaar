This innovation will help you in the grocery store. In this time of isolation where it is very difficult for government and officials to maintain social distancing in our country and where people rush to these stores when some lockdown is announced, this app will be a mediator between those grocery store and its customer, where the customer will send a list of his/her items and automatically a time slot will be allocated to them in which they just need topic the bag which is already prepared by the shopkeeper, pay the bill and leave. Simple but very effective. The best part about this app is we don’t need any personal information like email or phone number or anything to register, we actually don’t even register you to our database. Rather we just keep your data to your phone and is only send to the shopkeeper when you send the list of items you want from them. I would like to point out that we are open source and this app is free for use, we don’t charge money for this service. This is just an initiative towards Vocal for Local and Digital India while helping our fellow Indians in any way possible.
